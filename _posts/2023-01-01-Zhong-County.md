the past 30 years, this research, with the method of analyzing the career of the political
elites, to do a multi-level and -angle investigation of their changes and promotion since
1978,and mainly seeks to provide a panorama of Zhong County cadres and their complete
political career.

The system of constituents of the cadres of Zhong County, consisting of the Deputy
Section, the Section, the Deputy Division, and the Division, is like a pyramid. 60% of
the cadres come from rural families, 20% from cadre families; and 90% are male, 10% female.
Their ages range from 35 to 55 years old. Those of them who received full-time schooling
were the unprecedented “generation of the secondary school”, of whom quite a large part
studied both arts and sciences, the others studying only the former or the latter. On the
contrary, those who got their degrees on-job mostly have Bachelor’s or Master’s degree,
majoring mostly in arts. Generally speaking, the cadres are the local elite, with most
of those below the Division hailing from Zhong County, and those above the Deputy Division
basically from other parts of Beishan City than Zhong County. It is obvious, however, that
their birthplaces are not evenly distributed, as can be seen from the prominent phenomenon
of a specific colony of elite cadres originating from the same place.
