## Master of Engineering - Software (MEng Soft)

### Program overview
This high-impact program enables you to complete your degree in as little as eight months – the fastest graduate degree we offer. This MEng in software engineering will equip you with the programming knowledge you need to advance your career in an increasingly digitized engineering environment. Preparation courses are built in to the program if you have no software engineering background. This one-term “boot camp” gets you up to speed before you start the core degree courses. If this is your situation, you will complete your degree in 12 months, taking three preparation courses and 10 core courses over three terms. If you already have a software engineering undergrad, or electrical engineering undergrad with a minor in computer engineering, you could complete the 10 core courses over two terms. We designed this expedited program to meet a high market demand for software engineering expertise, as a result, it requires a full-time commitment.
* **Preparation courses:** For engineers with no software engineering background, three courses make up a boot-camp style semester to update your programming skills and knowledge.
* **Core courses:** 10 courses are required to complete this degree. Core topics include: Agile Software Engineering, Software Release Planning, Software Engineering Standards and Models, Advanced Software Testing, Automated Software Engineering and more. Two of the 10 courses are a team design project.
* **General engineering courses:** Students may select up to two general engineering courses as part of the 10 courses required. Topics include innovation and entrepreneurship, ethics, law and the engineering profession, project management and engineering tools.

How about a yummy crepe?

It can also be centered!

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}
